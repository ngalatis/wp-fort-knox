# WP Fort Knox - The Paranoid Security Plugin

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Author:** WEFIXIT

A zero-tolerance WordPress security plugin that locks down your site tighter than Fort Knox. Because paranoia is just good planning.

---

## üéâ What's New in Version 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 introduces a fundamental philosophical shift in how this plugin operates. Instead of **permanently nuking capabilities** from the WordPress database like some kind of security-drunk cowboy, we now use **runtime filtering**. What does this mean for you?

### The Big Changes:

- **‚ú® Non-Destructive by Design** - Capabilities are filtered at runtime, not permanently deleted. When you disable the plugin, everything returns to normal automatically. No more manual restoration ceremonies.

- **üîß Temporary Disable Feature** - Add `define('WP_FORT_KNOX_DISABLED', true);` to wp-config.php and the plugin steps aside gracefully. Need to do some emergency work? Boom, done. Remove the constant when finished.

- **üì¢ Admin Notices** - The plugin now actually tells users why they can't do things instead of silently crushing their dreams. Revolutionary, we know.

- **üèóÔ∏è Cleaner Architecture** - Properly structured as a class because we're professionals (sometimes).

### Why This Matters:

**Version 1.0.0 was a sledgehammer.** It permanently removed capabilities from user roles in the database. Effective? Sure. Reversible? Not without incantations and WP-CLI knowledge. If you disabled v1.0.0 without running the restoration commands, your admins were still crippled. That's not security, that's just being mean.

**Version 2.0.0 is a velvet rope.** Same security, zero permanent damage. The capabilities are still there in the database, we just filter them out when WordPress checks them. Disable the plugin and WordPress goes back to normal business immediately.

Same paranoia, better execution.

## üîÑ Upgrading from Version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

If you're running v1.0.0, you need to upgrade. Not "should upgrade" - **need to upgrade**. Here's why and how.

### Why Upgrade?

Version 1.0.0 permanently strips capabilities from your WordPress database. If something goes wrong, you're manually fixing it. Version 2.0.0 gives you the same security without the permanent consequences. It's a no-brainer.

### The Upgrade Process

**Step 1: Understand Your Current State**

If you've been running v1.0.0, your administrator role (and possibly other roles) have already had their plugin management capabilities permanently removed from the database. This is not a drill - they're actually gone.

**Step 2: Replace the Plugin File**

Via SSH or SFTP:

```bash
# Navigate to mu-plugins
cd /path/to/wp-content/mu-plugins/

# Backup the old version (just in case you enjoy suffering)
cp wp-fort-knox.php wp-fort-knox-v1-backup.php

# Replace with v2.0.0
# Upload the new wp-fort-knox.php file here
```

**Step 3: Restore the Capabilities v1.0.0 Destroyed**

This is the critical step. Version 1.0.0 destroyed these capabilities, and they don't magically come back. You need to restore them manually so that v2.0.0 can properly filter them at runtime.

Via WP-CLI:

```bash
# Option A: Nuclear option - Reset all roles to WordPress defaults
# This is the easiest and most reliable method
wp role reset --all

# Option B: Surgical option - Restore just the plugin capabilities
# Use this if you have custom role configurations you want to preserve
wp cap add administrator install_plugins
wp cap add administrator upload_plugins
wp cap add administrator update_plugins
wp cap add administrator delete_plugins
wp cap add administrator activate_plugins
wp cap add administrator edit_plugins

# If you modified other roles in v1.0.0, restore their capabilities too
wp cap add editor install_plugins
wp cap add editor upload_plugins
# ... etc
```

**Step 4: Verify Everything Works**

```bash
# Check that capabilities are back in the database
wp cap list administrator | grep plugin

# You should see:
# install_plugins
# upload_plugins
# update_plugins
# delete_plugins
# activate_plugins
# edit_plugins
```

**Step 5: Test the New Version**

1. Try to access the Plugins page in wp-admin (you should see a notice from WP Fort Knox)
2. Try to install a plugin via wp-admin (should be blocked)
3. Install a plugin via WP-CLI (should work perfectly)
4. Temporarily disable via wp-config.php to verify the disable feature works

### What If I Already Removed v1.0.0 Without Restoring Capabilities?

Then your admin users are currently hobbled and you didn't even know it. Follow **Step 3** above to restore the capabilities, then install v2.0.0. This is exactly why v2.0.0 exists.

### Post-Upgrade Checklist

- ‚úÖ Plugin capabilities exist in database (verified via `wp cap list`)
- ‚úÖ v2.0.0 file is in mu-plugins directory
- ‚úÖ Plugin management is blocked in wp-admin (as intended)
- ‚úÖ Plugin management works via WP-CLI (as intended)
- ‚úÖ Temporary disable feature works (test it)

## üö® Installation - Must-Use Plugin Only

This plugin is **designed exclusively** for the `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder. It cannot and should not be installed as a regular plugin.

**Installation Steps:**
1. Copy `wp-fort-knox.php` to your `wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory
2. That's it. No activation needed. It runs automatically.
3. Seriously, don't try to install this as a regular plugin. It defeats the whole purpose.

---

## üîí What Does This Thing Actually Do?

This plugin takes the nuclear option and **completely strips admin permissions** for anything file-related through the WordPress admin interface:

- ‚ùå **No file modifications** - Can't edit themes, plugins, or any other files
- ‚ùå **No plugin management** - Can't install, update, or delete plugins
- ‚ùå **No admin user creation** - Can't create new administrator accounts
- ‚ùå **No role elevation** - Can't promote existing users to administrator
- ‚ùå **Administrator role hidden** - Doesn't even appear in the user role dropdown

### But Wait, There's More!

- ‚úÖ **WP-CLI still works perfectly** - All admin operations work through command line
- ‚úÖ **Security logging** - Attempts to create admin users are logged with IP addresses
- ‚úÖ **Network compatible** - Works on WordPress multisite installations
- ‚úÖ **Capability monitoring** - Actively prevents unauthorized permission escalation

---

## ü§î Why Take the Nuclear Option?

Let's be real here. Clients want administrator accounts because they like feeling in control. Fair enough. But here's the harsh truth: **clients are incredibly careless with their credentials**. They write them on sticky notes, use "admin/password123", and click every phishing link that lands in their inbox.

### The Attack Pattern Everyone Falls For:

1. Attacker steals admin credentials (easier than you'd think)
2. Logs in as the legitimate admin (no flags raised)
3. Creates additional admin accounts quietly
4. Installs backdoor plugins that provide persistent access
5. Comes back later to wreak havoc at their leisure

### How WP Fort Knox Stops This Dead:

Even if an attacker gets valid admin credentials, they **can't do jack shit** through the WordPress admin:

- Can't create additional admin accounts to hide their tracks
- Can't install backdoor plugins to maintain access
- Can't modify files to inject malicious code
- Can't escalate privileges of existing accounts

**Assuming there's no shell access with the same credentials** (and there shouldn't be), the attacker is essentially locked out of doing any real damage through the UI. They got credentials? Great. They're worthless.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è "But What If the Client Wants to Install/Update Something?"

Tough luck. They go through you, the developer. 

Look, I don't care what they want to install. Half the time clients install bloated, poorly-coded plugins that create more problems than they solve. The other half they decide to update their whole site on a Friday night and then ruin your weekend because it broke after the updates. This way, we maintain quality control and actually know what's running on the site.

**Added bonus:** This can be excellent leverage for clients who mysteriously "forget" to pay their bills on time. No payment, no updates, hard to leave without your involvement. Simple business.

## üíª WP-CLI Commands - The Only Way to Admin

Since everything goes through WP-CLI now, here's your cheat sheet:

### User Management

```bash
# Create a new admin user
wp user create admin admin@example.com --role=administrator --user_pass=SecurePassword123!

# Promote existing user to admin
wp user set-role username administrator

# List all users with their roles
wp user list --fields=ID,user_login,roles

# Demote an admin user
wp user set-role username editor
```

### Plugin Management

```bash
# Install and activate a plugin
wp plugin install plugin-name --activate

# Update a specific plugin
wp plugin update plugin-name

# Update all plugins
wp plugin update --all

# List all installed plugins
wp plugin list

# Deactivate and delete a plugin
wp plugin deactivate plugin-name
wp plugin delete plugin-name
```

### Theme Management

```bash
# Install and activate a theme
wp theme install theme-name --activate

# Update a specific theme
wp theme update theme-name

# Update all themes
wp theme update --all

# List all installed themes
wp theme list
```

### Core Updates

```bash
# Update WordPress core
wp core update

# Update to a specific version
wp core update --version=6.4.1

# Check for updates
wp core check-update
```

### Disabling the Plugin (v2.0.0)

Need to temporarily disable WP Fort Knox? Easy. Version 2.0.0 made this civilized.

**Option 1: Temporary Disable (Recommended)**

Add this to your wp-config.php:

```php
define('WP_FORT_KNOX_DISABLED', true);
```

The plugin sees this and steps aside. All capabilities work normally. Remove the line when you're done. Simple.

**Option 2: Permanent Removal**

If you're really done with paranoia (bad choice, but whatever):

```bash
# Via SSH/SFTP, navigate to mu-plugins and remove the file
cd /path/to/wp-content/mu-plugins/
rm wp-fort-knox.php

# Or just rename it
mv wp-fort-knox.php wp-fort-knox.php.disabled
```

That's it. No capability restoration needed, no database cleanup, no prayer circles. The capabilities were never actually removed, just filtered. When the plugin's gone, the filters are gone, and everything works normally.

**Again, this is why v2.0.0 exists.**

## üîç Security Logging

Every attempt to create an admin user (successful or not) is logged to your error log with:
- Username
- User ID
- IP address of the request
- Timestamp

Check your WordPress debug log or server error logs to monitor suspicious activity.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Warnings

- **This plugin is aggressive by design.** It's not for everyone.
- **WP-CLI access is required** for any administrative file operations.
- **Existing admin users keep their roles** but can't perform file operations through wp-admin.
- **Cannot be deactivated from wp-admin** (because it's in mu-plugins, duh).
- To disable: Add constant to wp-config.php or SSH in and delete/rename the file.

### ‚ú® Version 2.0.0: Non-Destructive Operation

**Good news: This plugin NO LONGER permanently destroys capabilities.**

Version 2.0.0 uses runtime filtering instead of database modification. When the plugin is active, it filters out plugin management capabilities when WordPress checks them. When the plugin is disabled, capabilities work normally again. No restoration needed, no database cleanup, no drama.

**If you're upgrading from v1.0.0:** See the upgrade instructions above. You'll need to restore the capabilities v1.0.0 destroyed before v2.0.0 can work properly.
